# 1 Step one is to create a server that has HTTP listening endpoints
- IOCs in Server Header Information

# 2 Then you need a client that will make requests of that endpoint


# 3 Ideally you add logic for keying the information in a way that is unique to both the endpoint, and your version of this agent.

# 4 After initalizing a call and getting information back you now have two way communication.

# 5 Setup beacon timing

# 6 Create modes for execution on server to use for control.

# 7 Pick a schema for transfering information to the client to be executed in execute mode

# 8 Execute command from server on client

# 9 Encode information, chunk information

# 10 Send chuncks back to server

# 11 Recieve and display information

# Execute
