# HTTP Workshop Lab


# Linux Desktop

In a terminal, navigate to the malware_c2_behavior folder.
`cd /home/pslearner/Desktop/LAB_FILES/malware_c2_behavior`

Open this folder in VSCode.
`code .`

In VSCode navigate to the HTTPC2>Server>src folder, and open the server.go file.

Open a terminal in VSCode by pressing ctrl+shift+`

Change directory to the server directory.
`cd server`

Run the server.
`go run server.go`


# Server
## Detection Evasion
Open a browser (firefox), and browse to your server address.
> Notice it says Initiation Ironcat Server. That is not really what you want people to see if they happen to notice traffic to your malware c2 server right? So let's change it.


### Server Re-Direct
In the code, uncomment the following code around line ~73 and comment out using "//" the following line "c.HTML(http.StatusOK, "index.html", nil)"

Now rerun.  

Again browse to the server. 
>Now this server redirects to another location. This is the same as the default behavior of the recently researcehd chinese manjusaka c2 that is supposed to be a replacement for cobalts strike.

To the person using the browser this is only odd in that you are reffered to from a strange location.

If you check this in wireshark. And browse again, you will notice that it is now cached by the browser, so you don't get any additonal redirect messages.
`sudo wireshark&`  
> Capture on the loopback interface for localhost

Instead use curl with verbose, while leaving wireshark running.
`curl http://localhost -v`
> Notice the 301 in the response, this is your indicator that this is redirecting you to the provided location.


### Server Headers
Normal servers provide more headers than you see in the response as well. So this still doesn't look like a normal server. You check this by opening a browser outside of the lab. Open dev tools. (F12 most browsers.) And select the network tab. Now browse to Mircosoft.com

Select the initial request and view the response headers.

You will see something like:

```
content-length: 0
date: Sun, 07 Aug 2022 16:12:50 GMT
location: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000
tls_version: tls1.3
x-rtag: ARRPrd
```

Time to add a few headers of your own so your redirect looks legit. In VSCode, uncomment the line ~66 adding three headers. Location and date already exist, you can see those in the curl response. Looks like we need to add a few other options.

Save and re-run the server.

`go run server.go`

Use curl to check the headers for the redirect now.
`curl http://localhost -v`
> Now this is started to look pretty "normal" of course you can make the interaction even more normal by copying the actual microsoft server behavior exactly. But notice how we lie about our tls version? 

### Server Content
A brief note on contnet. When we decide to use something other than the body of the messages to send C2 information back and forth. You want the content to not be something like "Ironcat Server Initiating" so that it is more realistic. In your browser, not in the lab, browse to Microsoft.com one more time.  Now use file>save to save a copy of the page. (No it won't be a perfect copy)  

Now open the file on your system.  See it isn't a perfect copy...but it isn't terrible, and when you analyze this traffic and see this code in the packets, it makes it looks even more legit.

This is what is saved in the directory you are running the server.  Change the name of the current index.html file to "index-old.html"

Now change the name of the microsoft.html file to microsoft-index.html.

Restart the golang server.

Run curl against your server, but this time agains a specific endpoint, the checkin endpoint that the client will be hitting more often than the root "/" location.
`curl http://localhost/checkin -v`
> Now this looks like normal web traffic!  

## A quick note about Ports

Notice at the bottom of the code that referecnes port 80 being used.  Let's talk about that for a moment.


# Client
Enough about the server, this thing isn't as fun if you just host it by yourself...you need clients!

If you have a wireshark capture going, go ahead and stop it.

Find your server IP.  I should be 172.31.24.10
`ip addr`

Keep note of this for client configuration.

## Initial Conversation
Compile the server. In vscode kill the currently running server with `ctrl+c` and run the following command.
`sudo go build server.go`

This will generate an elf file. In a separate terminal. In a new terminal window, browse to the directory housing the elf file you just created. 

Then in that same terminal windows, use chmod to make the file executable.
`chmod +x server`

Now, run the executable.
`sudo ./server`
> It should be error free and look the same as the other times you ran the server. Enter 0 for the mode.

Back in VSCode, open the client.go file. This is located in the **/c2_behavior/ichttpc2/client** directory.

In the top of the file make sure the variable "ip" is set to 127.0.0.1.

In the VSCode terminal, change directory to the client folder and run the client to make sure it connects.
`sudo go run client.go`

With success it is time to compile the client and move it over to the Windows machine.  But first change the IP to the IP of your server (It should be 172.31.24.10)

Now in the VScode Terminal run the following command:
`sudo GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build client.go`
>This should cross compile the binary to run on windows.

In the same terminal run the following command to host the file.
`python -m http.server`

Swap to the Windows Victim Desktop.

Open a browser, and browse to the IP of the linux server. at port 8000  http://<server-ip>:8000, and click the client.exe file to download.

Open a commnad line terminal on windows. 

Change directory to where you downloaded the file.
`cd c:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\`

Run the client in the terminal.
`client.exe`

Swap back to the linux desktop server to make sure the terminal hosting your server elf file shows the connection.  Make sure to give it responses as it comes in every 30 seconds or so.  If they build up you may need to restart the server and client.

## User Agent
With C2 up and running. Time to take a look at the traffic. In a new terminal open wireshark.
`wireshark` and reset the capture filter to **tcp port http** start the capture.
> Make sure you use sudo so you have rights to the interfaces.


Once you see your connections coming in. Make sure to interact with the c2 a bit.  Explore the traffic by right clicking and using "follow HTTP"
> Take a look atthe user agent field. Go-http-Client is commonly used for this sort of thing and is a bit of a dead give away. 

User Agents are used as indicators but take a look at how easy this is to change. 


On the windows device, stop the client from running. `ctrl+c`

Stop capture in wireshark.  


In VSCode on your Linux Desktop, with the client.go open. Uncomment the lines that add a non default user agent to each function. Checkin, OsEnum and C2.  Uncomment the line that says "req.Header.Set("User-Agent", user_agent)
Line ~56,91,112

Save and recompile.
`sudo GOOS=windows GARCH=x64 go build client.go`
> You may need to rename the exisiting file named client.exe in that location or atleast ensure it was over written.

Re-host for with Windows
`python -m http.server`

On the windows victim server, in your command line terminal. Make sure the old client is no longer running. The delete the old file.
`del client.exe`

Again browse to the http://172.31.24.10:8000 location and download and run the new client.exe file. You may also need to re-run the server elf file on the linux server.

Restart Wireshark. Filter for http.
`tcp port http`

Interact with the c2 server.

Check ont the Wireshark traffic.
> You will notice a brand new user agent.  And just how easy that is to change. Also, something you may see being set in the code.

## Request Headers

Something elese you may have notices is that headers are kinda light on the http side.

Shut down the client on the Windows Machine.

On the Linux server, stop capturing on wireshark.

For reference, on your own browser, open up dev tools to the network tab. Browse to microsoft.com. Find the transaction for en-us. Look at the request headers...Those seem pretty significant. So our bare bones headers are a little sparse. Time to emulate a bit more.

Back in VSCode on the linux server, look at lines ~59-61 and uncomment them. They all start with "req.Header.Add"

Save and recompile.
`sudo GOOS=windows GARCH=x64 go build client.go`
> You may need to rename the exisiting file named client.exe in that location or atleast ensure it was over written.

Re-host for with Windows
`python -m http.server`

Run the new client.

On the linux server, run wireshark and check out the new traffic pattern.  Now it is starting to be difficult to decipher this from real microsoft traffic (except for one big thing).  Play around with C2 a bit while watching the traffic pattern in wireshark.

Setting the mode to 1 will send back os enumeration data. 2 will ask you for a command that will run on the device.
>Notice that the command information is not obfuscated at all!


## Hiding the Content

On the windows victim. Stop the client.exe process and delete the file.

On the linux desktop, stop the server process and open up vscode.

Could use encryption, no not base64!  Or we can just use HTTPS. You will work with that next.
